### Ready, Steady, Go!

We, MadrHacks group, wanted to have some fun and improve our skills and team collaboration so we joined the [Auburn CTF](https://ctf.auburn.edu/). This is our first CTF match! üéâ. The competition had a monstrous amount of playing teams, almost 1200! The CTF included ~55 challenges divided into multiple categories:
- **OSINT** aka Open Source INtelligence: This included some challenges to lookup the internet and find clues.
- **Crypto**: Cryptographic challenges (RSA, ...)
- **BASH**: Set of bash scripts to exploit (most of them solved with privilege escalation)
- **Reversing**: Reverse engineering of binaries
- **Pwn**: Still binary stuff üëÄ
- **Web**: Web challenges summarized in: CVE Apache, API testing, HTTP header, ...
- **Forensics**: Seach clues into network dumps
- **Password Cracking**: The old way üî®
- **Signals**: Challenges made of sinusoidal data (Audio, Radio transmissions, ...)
- **Sequence**: Math sequences

### The problems

Well, like every journey, there were problems like the server-side issues which caused the CTF site to respond very slowly (a turtle was faster üê¢). This slowness manifested also in the servers of the challenges, like bash, which went down multiple times leading our scripts to fail. 

These issues made us very angry but, at the end, all that slowness is comprehensible because of this was the first time [Auburn university](https://www.auburn.edu/) made a CTF and because of the astonishing amount of playing teams (remember that a lot of teams had more than one player!).

### The unexpected position

Every competition is fun because of the challenges, the players and the rollercoaster of emotions. Angry when cannot solve a problem after hours of tries and that uncontainable happiness when the flag appears. But there is another reason why every team join a game: the scoreboard. Everyone tries to be in the lead, putting everything to gain that 1st place. The same we did. Put together our individually skills, a mix of different language accents and we become an (almost) unstoppable superpower.

We finished the match on the **17th place**.

We are only at the beginning,

We know we get that 1st position, because

We are the MadrHacks!
