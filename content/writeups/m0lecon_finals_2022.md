# Attack Defence

# King Of The Hill (KOTH)

# Speedruns
The CTF featured a number of four speedrun challenges, which were Jeopardy-style challenges released every 2 hours. Unfortunately, we only solved the second one, but we got really close to solve the first one too!

Unfortunately, as the first one was related to making a scanner (which was on-site) scan an image, we cannot really try to solve it afterward the CTF ended ðŸ˜”.
