We are MadrHacks, 

We represent the hacking group of the [University of Udine](https://uniud.it) and we love to play CTF.

We tried hard to write a perfect text to describe us, but the only thing we came up with was this formula:

$$ 
\begin{matrix}
  \Bigg(\dfrac{PEOPLE}{(CS + LateralThinking)á›«Love}\Bigg)^{-1} \\
  \Vert \\
  MADRHACKS
\end{matrix}
$$
